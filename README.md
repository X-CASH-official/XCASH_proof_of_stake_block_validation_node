# X-CASH Proof of stake block validation node

More details will be released soon!

## Installation

This program will only run on a Linux/Unix OS at this time. We recommend installing this on a Ubuntu VPS/Server (16.04 or 18.04) for the best compatibility.

You will also need to run an X-CASH Daemon and X-CASH RPC wallet on the server. You can either download the latest X-CASH [release](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/X-CASH/releases) or build from [source](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/X-CASH#compiling-x-cash-from-source)

### Cloning the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node.git`



### Build instructions

X-CASH Proof of stake block validation node uses a Make file.

After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder  
`cd XCASH_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node`

Then use the make file to build the binary file  
`make clean ; make`



## Setting up the xcashd and xcash-wallet-RPC

First you will need to run xcashd in the background. Navigate to the folder that contains the xcash binaries, then run  
`screen -dmS Daemon ./xcashd`

Next you need to run a xcash-wallet-rpc. This wallet file needs to include the public XCA address you registered on the voting website.

Our recommendation is you use an empty wallet (no X-CASH in it) for this address. This way you will only leave mining rewards that you receive to this address on the VPS, not the entire X-CASH that you have. We also recommend at least once a week you should move the mining reward X-CASH that this wallet collects to your personal wallet.

If your running a shared masternode you will need to leave most of the mining rewards on the VPS, since the [link to shared masternode github repo](link to shared masternode github repo) will automatically pay the people contributing to your node.

To run the rpc wallet you can run  
`./xcash-wallet-rpc --wallet-file NAME_OF_WALLET_FILE --password WALLET_FILE_PASSWORD --rpc-bind-port 18285 --confirm-external-bind --daemon-port 18281 --disable-rpc-login --trusted-daemon`

Just replace NAME_OF_WALLET_FILE with the name of your wallet file and WALLET_FILE_PASSWORD with the password of that wallet file. Make sure to use port 18285 as this is the port that is used in the program.

We suggest you use the screen command to run the program in the background, this way you can still maintenance the server. To do this run  
`screen -dmS Daemon ./xcashd`

You can also run the RPC wallet this way as well  
`screen -dmS RPC-Wallet ./xcash-wallet-rpc --wallet-file NAME_OF_WALLET_FILE --password WALLET_FILE_PASSWORD --rpc-bind-port 18285 --confirm-external-bind --daemon-port 18281 --disable-rpc-login --trusted-daemon`

To bring the screen from the bacground process to the active process run  
`screen -x NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN`

Where NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN would be Daemon or RPC-Wallet in the above examples.

To exit a screen if it is the active process, you can press Control + C. To exit a screen that is a background process you can run  
`screen -XS NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN quit`



## Running X-CASH Proof of stake block validation node test
It is recomeneded to run the X-CASH Proof of stake block validation node test before you run the main program. The test will ensure that your system is compatbile, and that you have setup your system correctly.

To run the X-CASH Proof of stake test, Navigate to the folder that contains the binary, then run  
`./xcash_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node --test`

The test will return the number of passed and failed test on the bottom of the console. The failed test need to be 0 before you run the node. If the output is not showing 0 for failed test, then you need to scroll through the testing output and find what test failed (It will be red instead of green). If this is a system compatibility test, then you will need to fix the system. If this is a core test that has failed, then you need to possibly rebuild, or contact us with your OS version, and we can look into it.



## Running X-CASH Proof of stake block validation node
Then you will need to run the xcash_proof_of_stake. Navigate to the folder that contains the binary, then run  
`./xcash_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node`

We suggest you use the screen command to run the program in the background, this way you can still maintenance the server. To do this run  
`screen -dmS xcash_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node ./xcash_proof_of_stake_block_validation_node`

To bring the screen from the bacground process to the active process run  
`screen -x NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN`

Where NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN would be xcash_proof_of_stake in the above example.

To exit a screen if it is the active process, you can press Control + C. To exit a screen that is a background process you can run  
`screen -XS NAME_OF_BACKGROUNDS_SCREEN quit`
